When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Repositories are good to backup your code, and it is very convenient the fact that 
    you can access your code from different computers anytime, anywhere, you can always 
    keep it up to date, and also it is a good way of sharing your code with someone.
    Likewise, when people work collaboratively on the same project a remote repository is 
    a good idea.
